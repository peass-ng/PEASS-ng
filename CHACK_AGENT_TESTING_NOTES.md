# Chack Agent Testing Notes

This branch is intentionally prepared to validate automated CI-fix workflows.

## Why this exists
- Provide a simple and explicit branch-level note for maintainers.
- Exercise failure-triggered automation in a controlled way.

## Cleanup reminder
After workflow validation is complete, revert the intentional CI break commit.
